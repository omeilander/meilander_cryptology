Hi Jim.

This is the beginnings of my project. I plan to keep this updated so you
can check in at anytime you want. I will keep a log of my progress so you
can see what I'm doing and where I'm at. I'm also going to leave a place
for me to ask rhetorical questions and voice concerns and a place you keep
comments on things you think are good/need to change and maybe a. Other
than that, I plan to keep a to-do list and maybe other lists. Thanks again
for everything!!



Questions:
What should we call this?   
I don't really like what I call things... like I have the Encrypt class but
then I have to call the definition "encodeHill" so like i feel like I'm
mixing encrypt and encode... is this bad?   
Function cipher or just Permutation??      
Hill for more than just a block of 2?   
AffineHill??   



To-Do:

Kaski Test   
Kappa Test   
Keyed Column Transposition   
crack object!!!!!   



Log?:

I'm just going to add everything I've done up until this point. I have
Mathematics of Secrets but not the other book yet. I've been reading to
catch up to where we were in class and I'm making it. I can see how strongly
influenced your class was by this book. On the programming side of things, I
have the master program that can be easily imported and used as a sort of
repository. So far, I have Affine, Hill, Perm, and Vig in the Master program
with working examples of them being used to encrypt and decrypt.
