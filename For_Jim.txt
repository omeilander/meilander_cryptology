Hi Jim.

This is the beginnings of my project. I plan to keep this updated so you
can check in at anytime you want. I will keep a log of my progress so you
can see what I'm doing and where I'm at. I'm also going to leave a place
for me to ask rhetorical questions and voice concerns and a place you keep
comments on things you think are good/need to change and maybe a. Other
than that, I plan to keep a to-do list and maybe other lists. Thanks again
for everything!!

I'm just going to add everything I've done up until this point. I have
Mathematics of Secrets but not the other book yet. I've been reading to
catch up to where we were in class and I'm making it. I can see how strongly
influenced your class was by this book. On the programming side of things, I
have the master program that can be easily imported and used as a sort of
repository. So far, I have Affine, Hill, Perm, and Vig in the Master program
with working examples of them being used to encrypt and decrypt.

Massive work on a GUI. Also, the second book has arrived. Working on reading
but coding has taken priority.

5/28/20:
Almost caught up in both books to new information. I finished the basics of the
GUI for the systems I currently have. I have also messed around with converting
the python program to an executable and it works, but I cannot upload it to git
because it is too big of a file. If you want the .exe just let me know!

Note for myself: "pyinstaller --onefile -w GUI.py"

5/30/20:
Autokey and KCT have been added to my list of ciphers. I have caught up with 
reading so on monday I will start on new information.
