# meilander_cryptology

This is my attempt to create a repository for different cryptographic systems.
It is still being currently worked on so documentation and such is much in the
future, but there are examples of how to use each system. Additionally, 
Master.py will be the main object imported and used in progams. As I get it to 
work, the use programs will be updated accordingly.

Note: At this time any "use...All.py" programs are meant to be able to brute 
force any of these ciphers. At this time, they are NOT functional with the 
Master program.
