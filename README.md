# meilander_cryptology

This is my attempt to create a repository for different cryptographic systems.
It is still being currently worked on so documentation and such is much in the
future, but there are examples of how to use each. Additionally, Master.py will
be the main object imported and used in progams. As I get it to work, the use
programs will be updated accordingly.
