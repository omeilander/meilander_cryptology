# meilander_cryptology
Needed Packages:
numpy
tkinter (only for GUI)



This is my attempt to create a repository for different cryptographic systems.
It is still being currently worked on so documentation and such is much in the
future, but there are examples of how to use each system. Additionally, 
Master.py will be the main object imported and used in progams. As I get it to 
work, the use programs will be updated accordingly.

A GUI is also in the process of being created. At this point, it is usable with
the Affine, Autokey, Keyed Columner Trasposition, Hill, Permutation, and Vigenere ciphers. This will continue to be
updated as time goes on.

Note: At this time any "use...All.py" programs are meant to be able to brute 
force any of these ciphers. At this time, they are NOT functional with the 
Master program.
